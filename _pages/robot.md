# FRoG BlueROV V1
<!-- italicized tex -->
*Robot Platform for **Uncertainty-Aware Acoustic Localization and Mapping for Underwater Robots***

We integrate the [BlueROV V2](https://bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/) with a [Blue Robotics 1D Ping sonar](https://bluerobotics.com/store/sensors-sonars-cameras/sonar/ping-sonar-r2-rp/) and a [Waterlinked A50 DVL](https://waterlinked.com/dvl?hsLang=en&utm_term=dvl%20a50&utm_campaign=WL+-+EN+-+B+-+Navigation+-+X&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5034108088&hsa_cam=14090066783&hsa_grp=124778154905&hsa_ad=536525874627&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-1416654926354&hsa_kw=dvl%20a50&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwj_ajBhCqARIsAA37s0zdI3eed7mL_3WpMk8r8tSRHeG5h47w5dUQ81YPHRJlcQjXuemOQH4aAnilEALw_wcB#Available-DVL-products) in addition to the onboard IMU in the flight controller and a barometer for Blue Robotics. We show an overview of the robot platform in the left figure below. To support the study of environmental disturbances and provide ground-truth reference for evaluation, we created a static mount to attach the BlueROV to the carriage in the [MHL](https://mhl.engin.umich.edu/) wave basin at the University of Michigan, as shown in the right figure below.
